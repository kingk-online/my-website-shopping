# Clone E-Commerce Website üõçÔ∏è
This project showcases a simple E-Commerce website created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It's important to note that the website is static, meaning that the buttons and links do not have any functional behaviors. While the website presents a visual representation of an E-Commerce platform, it does not support actual transactions or interactive features.

This project holds great significance for me as it represents a major milestone in my development journey. It is the largest project I have completed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, allowing me to demonstrate my skills in creating responsive and visually appealing web interfaces.

This project is inspired by a website that serves as a platform for practicing Bootstrap skills. Unfortunately, I cannot recall the specific name of the website at this time.
